Autonomous Web-Controlled Robot Algorithm README
Overview
This repository contains the software algorithm for an autonomous web-controlled robot developed as part of a project. The algorithm utilizes a combination of communication protocols, sensor inputs, and actuators to enable the robot to perform tasks such as autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and interactive behaviors in a game competition setting.

Features
Communication Protocols:

UDP broadcast and receiving
ESPnow transmission
I2C communication
Sensor Inputs:

Vive-sensing input
Ultrasonic sensor digital input
IR phototransistor input
Actuator Control:

Motor control specifications for robot head, left, and right motors
Functionality:

Autonomous navigation with functions for moveLeft(), moveRight(), moveForward(), and moveBackward()
Wall following
Police car and beacon tracking
Mode switching (automatic, manual, trophy, fake, and police modes)
Web-based slider user interface for manual control
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Arduino IDE (or any compatible IDE for ESP32)
ESP32 development board
Vive controllers and trackers
Ultrasonic sensor
IR phototransistor
Motor actuators
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-algorithm.git
Open the Arduino IDE and load the project.

Configure the IDE for your ESP32 board and set the necessary dependencies.

Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

Usage
Power on the robot and ensure all sensors and actuators are connected properly.

Access the web-based slider user interface to control the robot manually.

The robot is capable of autonomous navigation, wall following, and tracking police cars and beacons based on the selected mode.

Experiment with different modes and functionalities to observe the robot's behavior.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, refer to the documentation and comments within the code for guidance. Additionally, feel free to reach out to the project contributors for assistance.

Known Issues
Specific challenges with wall following (refer to section in the main documentation).

Limitations with IR remote sensors for beacon tracking (refer to section in the main documentation).
